## Hi! I'm Paul de Mascarel

I'm a [42](https://42network.org) student who finished the Common Core at [42 Barcelona](https://www.42barcelona.com).

<h2>What I'm looking for</h2>

I enjoy projects that challenge both logic and creativity, especially in advanced algorithms, graphics/game development, and Unix/low-level programming. I’m also excited to continue exploring cybersecurity and expanding my experience in web and mobile development.

💼 **Open to internships, part-time work, collaborations, freelance work, and remote opportunities**

<h2>Highlighted Projects</h2>

- **[ft_transcendence](https://github.com/pauldahacker/transcendence)**

A full-stack multiplayer Pong game built as the final project of the 42 Common Core.

Developed with Fastify (Node.js), TypeScript, Tailwind, and an SQLite microservice architecture, the project combines gameplay, user management, modern web design, blockchain integration, and 3D graphics.

- **[cub3D](https://github.com/pauldahacker/cub3d)**

A 3D graphics engine that uses raycasting to create a pseudo-3D environment from a 2D map.

The engine casts rays from the player's position in different directions to determine wall distances and render the 3D scene.

- **[push_swap](https://github.com/pauldahacker/push_swap)**

A high-performance sorting algorithm.

The goal is to sort a stack of integers the most efficiently using a set of limited operations, and the help of only one other stack.
For minimum points, we must sort 100 random numbers with < 700 operations. For maximum points, we must additionally sort 500 random numbers with < 5500 operations.
I managed to make an algorithm inspired by quicksort which sorts 100 numbers in ≈ 625 operations and 500 numbers in ≈ 4800 operations!
